→ In this challenge, we are provided with the executable file and they have provided the source code for it
→ If we see when executing the file after giving execute permissions, it says that we need to create a flag.txt file in the current directory.
→ After creating the flag.txt and executing the program it is asking for the input and it exits.

→ From the source code, we can use that there is use of gets(), which takes the input and have a vulnerability that it doesn’t check whether the buffer overflow can happen.

→ We can provide the input more than intended.
→ From the source code, we see that the variable buff1 can take the input of 100 bytes and we are trying to copy the data to buff2 which occupies only 16 bytes.
→ In order it to overflow the data, we have to provide 100 bytes of data.
→ When provided, it takes all the spaces provided by the other parameters and the buffer overflows.
