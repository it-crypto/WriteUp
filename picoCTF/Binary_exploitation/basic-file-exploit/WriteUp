→ In this we are given a program where we need to read the data and give the required inputs to get the flag.
→ From the source code we can trigger the flag by reading the data and giving the input as zero.

→ We can see that the in source code, in the function data_read(), there is a condition on which it satisfies it puts the flag.



















→ We need to check where this particular function is being called and then we need to check what inputs we need to give the give.

→ We need to give the option2 so that the function data_read will trigger.
