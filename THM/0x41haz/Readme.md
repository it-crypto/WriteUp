- In this challenge, we are given an executable file, in which the file is of unknown type.

- I have used the file command to know what type of file it is. It is ELF 64-bit MSB but it states it is not an executable.

- Somewhere the file format had changed, from the definition, we need to change some bits of the file so that we can know the original file.

- In order to alternate the header you can use any hexadecimal editor like hexcurse.

- The 5th byte defines format 32 bits (1) or 64 bits (2)

- The 6th byte defines endianness LSB (1)  MSB (1)

- I have used the hex editor to change the value of 6th bit to 1.

- The 6th bit is showing 2, lets change to 1 and see what type of file it is.

- After changing the 6th bit to 1, and executing file command on the executable we can see that is the stripped 64-bit MSB executable file.

- I have performed strings operation to check if I can find any hint or flag, but I didnâ€™t find anything.

- I have used Ghidra tool to see if I can find anything related to what input is being compared to.

- I have analysed and from entry function we can see that it is calling some other function.

- From that function, I found some parameters are being passed and they are performing some operation with the parameters.

- As it is little-endian, the MSB(Most significant bit) is placed last and the LSB is placed first so we need to reverse the values and give it as input.

- Here there are three variables, I appended the three and gave it as input to the executable.
