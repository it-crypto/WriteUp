* In this room, we will be learning about AES CBC bit flipping attack.
* AES : Advanced Encryption Standard
* CBC : Cipher Block Chaining method.
* Cipher block chaining (CBC) is a mode of operation for a block cipher -- one in which a sequence of bits are encrypted as a single unit, or block, with a cipher key applied to the entire block. Cipher block chaining uses what is known as an initialization vector (IV) of a certain length.
