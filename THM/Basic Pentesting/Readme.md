# Basic Pentesting

In this challenge, we'll learn the following:
* brute forcing 
* hash cracking 
* service enumeration
* Linux Enumeration

# Scanning

* First we use nmap for scanning the network.

* here we found the services ssh, smb,..

# Brute-forcing the URLs

* We can use gobuster, dirbuster for enumerating the hidden files in the URL.

* We have found the hidden directory: /development.
* When accessing the URL, we found the two files, from the files we found some hints.

* From the files, we found that there are two users (J and K) and they mentioned about smb and mentioned that the password is not hashed properly.
* For smb, lets use enum4linux to find about users

# SMB-shares

* From this, we found that the user names.

* We knew a username and the service, lets use any password cracking tool to get the password so that we can access the service.

# Password-cracking (Dictionary attack)  -- Hydra

* Hydra is a brute-forcing tool that helps penetration testers and ethical hackers crack the passwords of network services. 
* Hydra can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols. 
* This includes telnet, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, databases, and several other services.
* Syntax: hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://IP

* We found the password for the service

# SSH Login

* Using the username and password we logged to the ssh server

* After checking the directories, we came across kay directory and there we found ssh directory which is having rsa private key.

# Hash Cracking

* Copy the private key, perform ssh2john to create a hash.

*  Then give the created hash as input to the john the ripper for cracking.

# Service Enumeration

*  After getting the passphrase from hash cracking, try to login as kay from ssh and access the file.

* After logging in as kay, when checking the list of files, we found one file, when viewed the contents, we got the flag.
